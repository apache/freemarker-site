      FreeMarker 1 (Classic) was originally written by
      <a href="mailto:beroul@users.sourceforge.net">Benjamin Geer</a> and 
      <a href="classic@zzzcomputing.com">Mike Bayer</a>. They defined the basic 
      syntax -- and more importantly, the philosophy -- of the tool that is 
      carried on in FreeMarker 2. Significant contributions to FreeMarker 
      Classic were made by Nicholas Cull, Holger Arendt and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early 2002, <a href="mailto:jon@revusky.com">Jonathan Revusky</a> rewrote the core
      (parser/compiler) code using a popular parser generator tool,
      JavaCC. This was really the basis of FreeMarker 2 (Lazarus),
      which, though largely backward compatible with FreeMarker 1 (Classic)
      is virtually a complete rewrite. He is an independent
      software developer and consultant, available in particular for
      work on java and open-source technologies. He can be reached by email via 
      <a href="mailto:jon@revusky.com">jon at revusky.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.szegedi.org">Attila Szegedi</a> has made
      significant contributions to the Lazarus release. Besides refactoring and
      optimizing some of the core API's for the Lazarus release,
      Attila is the main author of the date/time support, 
      <tt>freemarker.ext.*</tt> packages responsible for JavaBeans, Jython, and 
      XML mappings, as well as for HTTP servlet, JSP and Ant integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dániel Dékány is the main author and maintainer of the documentation.
	    Since 2011-05, he also does most of the maintenance work, new features, and the releases.
      Earlier, many features of FreeMarker were introduced or substantially improved
      based on his ideas. He is the author of FMPP, the tool that saves
      FreeMarker users from writing Java code when they just want to process
      some templates to generate corresponding output files.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://sixlegs.com/">Chris Nokleberg</a> is a FreeMarker
      "power user" who makes life difficult for the other developers by
      requesting new features and using the BeansWrapper in horrifying
      ways. He attempts to redeem himself by occasionally fixing bugs
      and implementing such features himself.
    </p>
    <p>
       <a href="mailto:stephan@chaquotay.net">Stephan Mueller</a> is
       the author of the new FreeMarker plugin for the Eclipse
       IDE. Stephan studies computer science at the University of Technology
       in Aachen, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other ideas and feedback 
      were provided by the various participants on the 
      freemarker-devel and freemarker-user mailing lists. People who are interested 
      in influencing (and even participating in) further  FreeMarker development are strongly 
      encouraged to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=794">subscribe</a>...

    <p>
      By community consensus, FreeMarker 2 release is under the more 
      liberal BSD-style license. (FreeMarker Classic was released under the 
      LGPL.) Benjamin Geer, the main author of FreeMarker 1, remained the 
      copyright holder of FreeMarker versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x. It was decided that, 
      since we did not at that point have a juridical entity (such as the Apache Foundation) 
      to play this role, that Benjamin Geer would continue to be the sole copyright 
      holder. Though various people have contributed to FreeMarker development, to have one 
      individual be copyright holder would make future license changes or 
      clarifications simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of FreeMarker 2.2, the copyright holder of the FreeMarker codebase
      is the Visigoth Software Society, 
      a non-profit association based in Spain, and co-founded by Jonathan Revusky 
      in December of 2002. Benjamin Geer graciously agreed to cede the copyright
      to VSS on the understanding that it would remain available under a liberal
      open-source license. The terms of the license remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of FreeMarker 2.3.21, the license has changed to the Apache
      License, Version 2.0, and the owner has changed from Visigoth Software
      Society to three of the FreeMarker 2 developers, Attila Szegedi,
      Daniel Dekany, and Jonathan Revusky. The change was needed because the
      old license wasn't OSI approved, and because of the inactivity of the
      Visigoth Software Society.
