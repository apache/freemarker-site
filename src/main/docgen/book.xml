    <title>What is Apache FreeMarker™?</title>

    <para>Apache FreeMarker™ is a <emphasis>template engine</emphasis>: a Java
    library to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration
    files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data. Templates
    are written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL), which is a simple,
    specialized language (not a full-blown programming language like PHP).
    Usually, a general-purpose programming language (like Java) is used to
    prepare the data (issue database queries, do business calculations). Then,
    Apache FreeMarker displays that prepared data using templates. In the
    template you are focusing on how to present the data, and outside the
    template you are focusing on what data to present.</para>

    <para>This approach is often referred to as the MVC (Model View
    Controller) pattern, and is particularly popular for dynamic web pages. It
    helps in separating web page designers (HTML authors) from developers
    (Java programmers usually). Designers won't face complicated logic in
    templates, and can change the appearance of a page without programmers
    having to change or recompile code.</para>

    <para>While FreeMarker was originally created for generating HTML pages in
    MVC web application frameworks, it isn't bound to servlets or HTML or
    anything web-related. It's used in non-web application environments as
    well.</para>

      <para>A few highlights of FreeMarker:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Powerful template language: Conditional blocks, iterations,
          assignments, string and arithmetic operations and formatting, macros
          and functions, including other templates, escaping by default
          (optional), and many more</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Multipurpose and lightweight: Zero dependencies, any output
          format, can load templates from any place (pluggable), many
          configuration options</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Internationalization/localization-aware: Locale sensitive
          number and date/time formatting, localized template
          variations.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>XML processing capabilities: Drop XML DOM-s into the
          data-model and traverse them, or even process them
          declaratively</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Versatile data-model: Java objects are exposed to the template
          as a tree of variables through pluggable adapters, which decides how
          the template sees them.</para>

    <para>Apache FreeMarker is a template engine: a Java library to generate
    text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code,
    etc.) based on templates and changing data.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dependencies:</emphasis> FreeMarker has no
    required dependencies, except Java (Standard Edition) itself, with the
    minimum version indicated for each download below.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Backward compatibility:</emphasis> Before
    2.3.0 (2004), releases with different second version numbers (like 2.2.x
    and 2.3.x) aren't fully compatible. The 2.3.x series is quite conservative
    about backward compatibility; you should be able to replace the FreeMarker
    binary (<literal>freemarker.jar</literal>) under your application with a
    newer one without breaking anything (obviously, assuming that only public
    FreeMarker API-s were used).</para>

      <note>
        <para>Until about 2007 the Maven group name was
        <quote>freemarker</quote> instead of <quote>org.freemarker</quote>,
        which breaks version conflict resolution. If you run into a dependency
        that still pulls in a such old FreeMarker version, you need to exclude
        it in its <literal>dependency</literal> element:
        <literal>&lt;exclusions&gt;&lt;exclusion&gt;&lt;groupId&gt;freemarker&lt;!--
        Legacy org-less group

        <para>Also, for most "Model 2" frameworks (like Maverick or Struts) it
        is easy to use FreeMarker templates instead of the MVC-oriented JSP

            release steps, you do many of them twice. Note that source code
            changes should be made in the 2.3-gae branch, and then merged into

        Users or fellow developers can use this Maven repository to try

        <para>To publish the snapshot version, fist check that
        <literal>version.properties</literal> contains the proper version,
        most importantly, that <literal>mavenVersion</literal> ends with
        <literal>-SNAPSHOT</literal>. (If not, it will deploy to the release

        <para>The content of the home page can be changed by committing it
        into the <literal>asf-site</literal> branch of the
        <literal>freemarker-site</literal> repository. However, you shouldn't
        directly edit the content of most HTML files there, as pretty much all
        of them are generated, and then is just manually copied over there.
        The generated pieces are:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The contents of the <literal>docs/api</literal> is generated

            <literal>site</literal> project). So to change the content, you
            should edit the documentation comments in the java files.</para>

            <para>The contents of <literal>docs/</literal> is generated from

            <literal><replaceable>&lt;freemarker-project&gt;</replaceable>/src/manual/en_US/book.xml</literal>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Most other content is generated from the
            <literal>site</literal> project, by issuing <literal>mvn -U

        <para>After you commit into the <literal>asf-site</literal> branch of
        the <literal>freemarker-site</literal> repository, it will
        automatically appear on the web site, with some small delay (a few
        seconds usually). If it doesn't, that's probably because of a known
        infrastructural glitch, where for too big commits this synchronization
        doesn't happen. In such case, commit some small change to trigger
        synchronization again.</para>

        <title>Updating Docgen</title>

        <para>Docgen (<literal>freemarker-docgen</literal> Git repository)
        generates HTML from a DocBook XML. It's a dependency of FreeMarker
        binary release building (as that contains the Manual in HTML format)
        and of <literal>freemarker-site</literal>.</para>

        <para>Docgen is not published to the Maven Central Repository (yet?),
        only into the Apache Maven Snapshot Repository. That works for us
        because it's an internal build dependency, and the dependent projects
        are set up to find it in the Apache Maven Snapshot Repository. If you
        modify Docgen, just issue <literal>mvn deploy</literal> to make the
        new version available for the later dependent builds.</para>

        <literal>docgen</literal> project
        (<literal>freemarker-docgen</literal> repository). That project also
        provides an XMLMind XML Editor (XXE for short) addon for editing these

        <title>Dealing with security vulnerabilities</title>

        <para>If someone reports a security vulnerability, normally they
        shouldn't do it on a public forum (<link
        linkend="report-security-vulnerabilities">see how to report it
        here</link>), and similarly we shouldn't discuss it on a public forum
        (such as on the developer mailing list), but on the private mailing
        list of the project. Thus the vulnerability can be fixed and released
        before it's openly discussed. As a developer, you must not forget that
        commits are also publicly visible. How to commit, release, and
        communicate a concrete vulnerability should be discussed on the
        private mailing lists of the project before doing publicly visible
        moves. See <link

    <section xml:id="history">
      <title>Project history</title>

      <para>FreeMarker wasn't started at the Apache Software Foundation;
      here's the legal history of the project:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>FreeMarker 1 was licensed under LGPL, and was copyright by
          Benjamin Geer.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>By community consensus, FreeMarker 2 was released under a more
          liberal BSD-style license. Benjamin Geer remained the copyright
          holder of FreeMarker versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x. It was decided that,
          since we did not at that point have a juridical entity (such as the
          Apache Foundation) to play this role, that Benjamin Geer would
          continue to be the sole copyright holder, make any future license
          changes or clarifications simpler.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>As of FreeMarker 2.2, the copyright holder of the FreeMarker
          codebase was the Visigoth Software Society (VSS), a non-profit
          association based in Spain, and co-founded by Jonathan Revusky in
          December of 2002. Benjamin Geer graciously agreed to cede the
          copyright to VSS on the understanding that it would remain available
          under a liberal open-source license. The terms of the license remain
          the same.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>As of FreeMarker 2.3.21 (released at 2014-10-12), the license
          has changed to the Apache License, Version 2.0, and the owner has
          changed from Visigoth Software Society to the three main FreeMarker
          2 developers, Attila Szegedi, Daniel Dekany, and Jonathan Revusky.
          The change was needed because the old BSD-style license wasn't OSI
          approved, and because of the inactivity of the Visigoth Software
          Society association.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Around 2015-07-01, FreeMarker was voted in into the <link
          xlink:href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</link>,
          and the project (all code from which the releases and the Web site
          are created, along with the right for using the
          <quote>FreeMarker</quote> product name) was granted to the Apache
          Software Foundation by the earlier owners. The license remains
          Apache License, Version 2.0. In 2015-09-02, the main code base was
          imported from GitHub into the Apache Software Foundation
          infrastructure, where development continues.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>On 2018-03-21 FreeMarker has graduated from the <link
          xlink:href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</link> to
          a top level project.</para>

      <para>Development history, key contributors:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Later 1999, FreeMarker 1 has appeared on SourceForge.net. It
          was originally written by Benjamin Geer and Mike Bayer. They defined
          the basic syntax, and more importantly, the philosophy of the tool
          that is carried on in FreeMarker 2. Significant contributions to
          FreeMarker 1 were made by Nicholas Cull, Holger Arendt and
          others.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In early 2002, Jonathan Revusky rewrote the core
          (parser/compiler) code using a popular parser generator tool,
          JavaCC. This was really the basis of FreeMarker 2, which, though was
          initially largely backward compatible with FreeMarker 1, is
          virtually a complete rewrite. <link
          xlink:href="http://www.szegedi.org/">Attila Szegedi</link> has made
          significant contributions to the FreeMarker 2. Besides refactoring
          and optimizing some of the core API's, Attila is the main author of
          the date/time support, <literal>freemarker.ext.*</literal> packages
          responsible for JavaBeans, Jython, and XML mappings, as well as for
          HTTP servlet, JSP and Ant integration. Dániel Dékány is the main
          author of the documentation, and has influenced many new features of
          FreeMarker 2, and has helped in maintenance work. Many ideas and
          feedback were provided by the various participants on the
          freemarker-devel and freemarker-user mailing lists, like <link
          xlink:href="http://sixlegs.com/">Chris Nokleberg</link>, <link
          xlink:href="http://stephan.notatoaster.org/">Stephan Mueller</link>,
          and many others.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Since 2011, Dániel Dékány does most of the maintenance work
          and new features.</para>
